# Isolating Satire with Machine Learning

## SI 206 Final Project

### By Efe Akinci and Michael Zhou

## Notes

In the interest of keeping file sizes small, we have not included the training data used to create the machine learning algroithm (~111MB).
If you are interested in exploring the training data, you can find the dataset we used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/).

## Introduction

Onion articles (and other satirical articles) are pretty funny. Even though they are written like news, we can usually tell that they are meant to be satire. But, we wondered, could a computer do the same?

## More info
Our final project report includes more information on what this project does, how it works, and how it could be improved. It is included in our project as "Final_Project_Report.pdf."

## "I don't have a the equipment to train the machine learning model."
