## Notes

In the interest of keeping file sizes small, we have not included the training data used to create the machine learning algroithm (~111MB).
If you are interested in exploring the training data, you can find the dataset we used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/).
