#Isolating Satire with Machine Learning
###SI 206 Final Project
######By Efe Akinci and Michael Zhou

##Preamble
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

In the interest of keeping file sizes small, we have not included the training data used to create the machine learning algroithm (~111MB).
If you are interested in exploring the training data, you can find the dataset we used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/).
##Introduction
For humans, it's quite simple to see whether an article is satirical or not by reading through it.

We wondered: Could we train a Machine to do the same?

##Methodology
First, we pulled real and fake news articles and their headlines from a publicly available database on Kaggle. [linked here]
