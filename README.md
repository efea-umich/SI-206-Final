# Isolating Satire with Machine Learning

## SI 206 Final Project

### By Efe Akinci and Michael Zhou

## Notes

In the interest of keeping file sizes small, we have not included the training data used to create the machine learning algroithm (~111MB).
If you are interested in exploring the training data, you can find the dataset we used [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/).

## Introduction

For humans, it's quite simple to see whether an article is satirical or not by reading through it.

We wondered: Could we train a Machine to do the same?

## Methodology

First, we pulled real and fake news articles and their headlines from a publicly available database on Kaggle. [linked here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/)

## Setting Up Your Own Virtual Environment

`py -m pip install virtualenv`
`\venv\Scripts\activate`

We have written a list of package/library requirements for the project in requirements.txt

To exit: `deactivate`
